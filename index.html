        <h1>No-Upload Text Anonymizer</h1>

        <p>This utility takes whatever text you paste in and jumbles it
        (replaces every alphabet character with a new, random alphabet
        character). It works in pure JavaScript, on <em>your</em> computer,
        and doesn't cache or remember or upload anything. You can use this
        script for things like anonymizing your NaNoWriMo novel, if you're
        ready to validate but it weirds you out to upload your work onto a
        server you don't have control over.</p>

        <h2>How To Use</h2>

        <p>Paste your text into the first text box, then copy the text from
        the second text box and put it wherever you need the anonymized
        text.</p>

        <h2>Caveats</h2>

        <p>Right now, this is designed for English text and only does the
        replacement for pure ASCII  characters, i.e., A-Z and a-z, with no
        accents. Also, the memory usage and speed of your browser are known
        limitations, since there's no server usage at all: in other words, if
        what you paste in is long, your browser may hang up for a second or
        two while it processes, or possibly even crash.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>


        <form>
            <p><textarea id = "input">Put your text to be anonymized here.</textarea></p>

            <p><textarea id = "output">Here's where the anonymized text will appear, as soon as you start editing the box above. (Add a space to watch it in action!)</textarea></p>
        </form>

            <h3>I Looked At Your Code. Why You Didn't Do It This Other, Better
            Way?</h3>

            <p>The short answer is: I wrote the utility in about 15 minutes on
            the morning I wanted to validate my NaNoWriMo results. My primary
            goal was getting something that did the thing without using up a
            lot of my time. Also, I'm not a JS dev, so I was really  winging
            it on the 'idiomatic JavaScript' front.</p>

            <p>That said, if "this other, better way" is a single random
            generation pass through the alphabet, which I then reused for the
            whole chunk of text: yes, you're right, that would be faster, but
            I didn't do it that way because that's a <a href =
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitution
            cipher</a>, and an eight-year-old with a sheet of paper can
            reverse a  substitution cipher. On something novel-
            length—<em>especially</em> in a computer context—that would
            basically be exactly equivalent to just pasting your raw text
            over, which is what I didn't want to do.</p>

            <p>If you're wondering why I kept the general sentence and word
            forms, i.e. lowercase letters replaced by other lowercase letters,
            uppercase letters replaced by uppercase letters, and punctuation
            and spaces left untouched, it's because (a) I didn't want to run
            the risk of accidentally lowering my word count by messing with
            word boundaries and (b) I know from an earlier string-garbling
            project that it scrapes against something really primal in your
            brain to look at a very large unit of text that looks like a
            ransom note from a penny dreadful, or otherwise doesn't obey the
            rules you expect for things like capitalization and punctuation. I
            don't have any idea why this happens; I just know that—for me at
            least—that's true, and also very annoying. The text that you get
            back from the anonymizer should look <em>basically okay</em>; the
            phonetics will be garbage, but hopefully it'll have less of that
            nails-on-chalkboard effect that you get from looking at a wall of
            text that is just <em>profoundly wrong</em>.</p>
